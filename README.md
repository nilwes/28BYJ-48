# Stepper-Motor

This example demonstrates bidirectional operation of a
28BYJ-48, using a VMA401 - ULN2003 interface board to drive the stepper.
The 28BYJ-48 motor is a 4-phase, 8-beat motor, geared down by
a factor of 64. One bipolar winding is on motor pins 1 & 3 and
the other on motor pins 2 & 4.
